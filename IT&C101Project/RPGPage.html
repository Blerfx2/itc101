    <h2>Dungeons and Dragons</h2>
    <p> Dungeons and Dragons (also known as DND) is a cooperative roleplaying game where a main storyteller, the Dungeon Master, takes a group through their own fantasy
        adventure. Each player is equipped with different skills to tackle different kinds of situations and gives the team different opportunities based on these skills
        How do we get into the hideout? Well, maybe the Rogue could pick a lock and get in or sneak around back and find an easy access point. Don't have a Rogue? Well 
        then maybe someone throws a rope up to the third floor. Forgot the rope in your other bag of holding? Then maybe our flashy spellcaster snaps their fingers and
        teleports the entire team up there with their dimension door spell. And if all else fails, well you at least got a sword and no one said a sword can't be a
        makeshift battering ram. At the end of the day, to me, DND is about having fun and making memories with my friends.

    <h2>Pokemon Tabletop United (PTU)</h2>
    <p>Like DND, there are other roleplaying games, also known as systems, that you can use to better adjust to different settings or gameplay styles. One of such is PTU,
        a RPG designed to let you go on your own pokemon adventure! One of the aspects of PTU that I enjoy the most is that it allows you as a player to fight along side
        and against pokemon. So this doesn't make just your pokemon really cool, but it makes you really cool by giving you different classes that synergize with each other
        and make you just as scary as the Steelix that is looking you in the eyes. If you want to check it out, here is my <a href="https://www.worldanvil.com/w/siloneer-blerfx" ping="https://www.worldanvil.com/w/siloneer-blerfx"><em>Siloneer</em></a> page. I promise that it has a lot more content than the DND page has
        Here is also an example of a character sheet in PTU. They are so complex that the fans made this spreadsheet.</p>
