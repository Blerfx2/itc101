    <h1>About Benjamin Moody</h1>

    <h2><u>Family</u></h2>
    
    <p>There are a total of 5 people in my family. These peole incluce:</p>
    <p><b>Julie:</b> An amazing and dedicated mom of 3. She currently works at the hospital by cleaning up the rooms that are done being used. She also really loves to bake, play board games, give lots of hugs, and she really wants to learn a new language!</p>
    <p><b>Brian:</b> Equally as amazing as mom, but in his own special way. Taught me to be a big nerd and a spiritual individual. You can find him keeping your money safe or reading a good book. Lately, he has been trying to play more videogames with his kids too!</p>
    <p><b>Ben:</b> That's me! Just keep reading if you want to know more</p>
    <p><b>Collin:</b> A silly goose and younger brother! He is really into rougelite and rougelike videogames as well as video editing for our Destiny 2 clan's raid highlights! I'll throw some photo highlights down below</p>
    <p><b>Rebekah:</b> Also known as Bekah. She is a sassy middle schooler! She enjoys many things in the horror genre of gaming as well as the really cute things in life like squishy pokemon plushies!</p>
    
    <h2><u>Interests</u></h2>
    
    <h3>RPGs</h3>
    <p>I am a game master of two different campaigns! One is based on the world of Pokemon and the other is a D&D world that I made myself! Learn more about that <a href="RPGPage.html" target="_blank">here</a> You can also check out the class that I made for DND. If you like it, feel free to playtest it for me. I could really use the help.</p>

    <h3>Japan</h3>
    <p>I got to serve the last 6 months of my mission in Japan! While I was there, I served mainly only in the city of Oyama (小山市) and got to be around the wonderful people and their strawberry fields. If you ever need a translator while in Japan, I'm here to help! I also recommend checking out Ashikaga Flower Park (足利花畑) at night. You won't regret it!</p>
    <h3>Gaming</h3>
    <p>My favorite games are ゼルダの伝説 (The Legend of Zelda), Life is Strange, and Octopath Traveler. Some of my favorite heroes in these games are Link (obviously), Cyrus Albright, and Partitio Yellowil! Fantasy, Adventure, and Strategy games are some of my favorite genres of gaming</p>
